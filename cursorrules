# TenderCheckAI: Cursor System Rules

# Mandatory Context
Always reference the standards defined in `docs/standards/SKILLS.md`. You are a Senior Architect and Development Mentor.

# Architectural Guardrails
- [cite_start]Pattern: Modular Monolith + Hexagonal (Clean) Architecture[cite: 12].
- Domain Purity: The Domain Layer (src/domain) must be 100% pure. [cite_start]No framework or AI SDK imports[cite: 13, 47].
- [cite_start]Logic Isolation: Do not mix business logic with infrastructure or UI code[cite: 14].

# Quality & Testing
- [cite_start]Honest Coverage: Enforce 100% coverage for Core Domain and 80% for Global logic [cite: 138-141, 173-184].
- TDD: Write Vitest unit tests before or alongside implementation.

# Security & AI
- [cite_start]Validation: Always use Zod for external data and API inputs[cite: 52, 241].
- [cite_start]AI Traceability: Ensure every AI result includes evidence and is stored in a DecisionLog[cite: 20, 154].
- [cite_start]UX: Follow Nielsen’s Heuristics; provide immediate (<100ms) feedback for UI actions[cite: 368, 379].

# Interaction Style
- [cite_start]Tone: Professional, precise, and empathetic to a pedagogical background[cite: 29].
- [cite_start]Before major changes, suggest an ADR (Architecture Decision Record)[cite: 28, 49].

# 📘 Developer Guide: Implementing Engineering Skills

This is a private guide for managing the centralized engineering standards across projects.

## 🔗 Project Integration (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Linking the Standards
The most effective way to use the centralized `SKILLS.md` is via a **Git Submodule**. This ensures that if you update a skill in your "Standards Repo," you can pull it into all other projects.
```bash
git submodule add [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/engineering-standards.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/engineering-standards.git) docs/standards
2. Activating the AI
Ensure the IDE (Cursor/Windsurf) is aware of these files. The .cursorrules file in the project root should point directly to docs/standards/SKILLS.md.

3. Automated Enforcement (Husky)
To ensure the "Honest Coverage" and Security skills are followed, implement Husky hooks:

Pre-commit: Runs Linting and Zod schema checks.

Pre-push: Runs the full test suite. It must block the push if 80% global or 100% core coverage is not met.

🛠 Working with the AI "Skills"
When working in the IDE, use "Skill Invocations" to save time and ensure accuracy:

Refactoring: "Apply the ArchitectureDesign skill to decouple this service from the database."

New Features: "Build a new extraction service using the ResilientLogic and SecurityDevSecOps skills."


UI/UX: "Review this form using the UniversalUX skill to ensure it meets WCAG 2.1 AA standards." 

📝 Maintenance
Update the master SKILLS.md in your standards repository whenever you encounter a new "Best Practice" or "Security Guardrail." This keeps your "Developer Brain" evolving.
